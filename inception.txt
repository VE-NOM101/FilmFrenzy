Nolan's film offers viewers a delightfully complicated film that requires the audience to play close attention.
The layers, the music, the hallway that rotates, it is all a ride that makes you want to hold on to your armrests.
It is a film that relishes in the CGI genre along with intense stunts and set building in order to bring authenticity to our dreams.
And Cotillard...stunning.
